# Personal site

This is my own website, about my interest and stuff.

## Development

I used Angular 6 for creating this page. Third party CSS frameworks aren't used. All design and interactivity are created by myself, for practising the creation process and deepen my knowledge.

This is also a platform where I occasionally try out new tricks I have read about.

There are still content to be uploaded... Stay tuned. :)
